            You're stuck in traffic on the way to work, just like every morning. And just like every morning, it's backed up off the 17th Street exit, because the traffic light there isn't timed right; it's on a 3-minute cycle, even though no one is coming through the cross street. Fixing that one light would take 15 minutes off your commute, not to mention the time saved by the thousands of people stuck in traffic with you. Why won't they fix that light?  Time to do something about it: you pick up your phone and fire off a Squeak.

          <p>
            At her desk at that very moment sits a traffic engineer, responsible for the placement and timing of thousands of traffic lights within the city. She has a backlog of studies to pour through to figure out what her next project is, and buried somewhere in that stack is a proposal to install detectors and implement dynamic timing on the 17th Street light. It's near the bottom of the stack, and she may not get to it for months, if ever. However, she's a Mechanic on Squeaky Wheel, so she logs in and peruses the database of traffic-related Squeaks to identify high-priority items. There's yours, and what's more, the people stuck in traffic with you have voted for it. You've drawn her attention to the issue, and as a result, your commute &mdash; and thousands of others &mdash; is about to get a lot shorter.
