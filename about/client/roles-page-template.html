        <h1>Roles at Squeaky Wheel</h1>
        <div class='text'>
          <p>Squeaky Wheel consists of two types of people: Pioneers, the people riding the wagon train of life and listening for squeaky wheels, and Mechanics, the people who grease those wheels to get everything running smoothly again.

          <h2>Pioneers</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Have you ever set off to accomplish a task, only to find out it's much harder than it has any reason to be?  Have you ever been inconvenienced and wanted a way to avoid it in the future?  Do you ever start thinking, "Wouldn't it be great if there were..."?  Congratulations, you're a Pioneer!
            </p>
            <p>
              Anyone can be a Pioneer; all it takes is a few seconds to describe the problem you're facing in a Squeak.  Pioneers in the Squeaky Wheel community can also vote for and discuss Squeaks that affect them.  The louder the Squeak, the more likely it is to be heard, and for a Mechanic to grease it.

          <h2>Mechanics</h2>
          <div>
            <p>
              Mechanics apply the proverbial grease to society's squeaky wheels.  These are the people who look at the problem and find a solution.

              Anyone can also be a Mechanic; it only requires a bit of imagination and a love for solving problems.  Mechanics tend to be entrepreneurs or established businesses, but they may also include local governnments or even active Squeaky Wheel community members.  You might be surprised what problems you're able to solve!
