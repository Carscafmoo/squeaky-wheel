      There are four <strong>workflow states</strong> for a Squeak:
    </p>
      <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
        {{#each workflowExplanations}}
          <dt>{{state}}</dt>
          <dd>{{explanation}}</dd>
        {{/each}}
      </dl>
      <div class='row standalone-row'>
        <div class='col-xs-9'>
          <p>
            Users can move a Squeak from one state to another by clicking on the workflow state dropdown:
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class='col-xs-3'>
      {{> workflowMenu exampleSqueak}}
      </div>
    </div><!--row-->
    <p>
      Any community member can become the <strong>Mechanic</strong> working on the Squeak by <strong>taking the Squeak to the shop</strong>.  Once there, only the Mechanic can remove the Squeak from the shop by <strong>giving up</strong> or <strong>proposing a solution</strong>.  The Squeak's original author can <strong>accept</strong> or <strong>reject</strong> the Mechanic's solution once the Mechanic has proposed one.  
    </p>
    <p>
      The Squeak can be moved into the <strong>greased</strong> state for one of a number of reasons:
    </p>
      <dl class='dl-horizontal'>
        {{#each greasedExplanations}}
          <dt>{{reason}}</dt>
          <dd>{{explanation}}</dd>
        {{/each}}
      </dl>
    <p>
      Once the Squeak has been greased, the Squeak is no longer editable, and <strong>discussion</strong> ends.
