      <strong>Notifications</strong> are generated whenever anyone performs an action on a Squeak or Axle you're <strong>watching</strong>.  When you have unread notifications, the <strong>notification badge {{> notificationBadge}}</strong> will display the number of unread notifications you have.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can view your notifications by clicking the <strong>"Activity" link</strong> in the page header.

        You can sign up to receive notifications about Squeaks or Axles.  Look for the 
          <button class='btn btn-default disabled'><span class='glyphicon glyphicon-eye-open'></span></button> button to start watching.
      </p>
      <p>
        Watching an Axle will trigger notifications if a Squeak is added to or removed from that Axle, and watching a Squeak will trigger notifications if the Squeak is edited, a user discusses that Squeak, or if its <strong>workflow state</strong> changes.
