      <strong>Viscosity rating</strong> <span class='glyphicon glyphicon-tint'></span> measures a user's reputation.  A user with a high viscosity rating can moderate the community and is allowed to initiate proposals that Squeaks be rejected or re-opened.  
    </p>
    <p>
      You can increase your viscosity rating by participating constructively in the community.  The following actions have the ability to increase your viscosity rating:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a Squeak</li>
      <li>Voting on a Squeak or proposal to change Squeak state</li>
      <li>Participating in a <strong>discussion</strong> of a Squeak or proposal</li>
      <li>Initiating a workflow state proposal</li>
      <li>Solving a Squeak</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Your viscosity rating can also decrease if your actions are harmful to the community, so think carefully before acting.  The following actions have the ability to decrease your viscosity rating:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Creating a Squeak that gets rejected</li>
      <li>Initiating a proposal that gets rejected</li>
      <li>Voting for a proposal that gets rejected</li>
      <li>Voting against a proposal that passes</li>
    </ul>

          As a new user, one of the easiest ways to increase your viscosity rating is to vote on and participate in <strong>discussions</strong> on Squeaks and proposals.
